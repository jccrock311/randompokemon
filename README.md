# Random Pokémon Tableau Challenge

Can we find similarities in 20 random Pokémon? Let's find out.

While it's not quite "catching them all", this is just a quick, small side project to display/contrast 20 random Pokémon utilizing [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It is almost entirely to practice my Tableau skills (become a Tableau Trainer, if you will...) and help maintain some of my Python skills as well. 

### Care to see my results?

The JN file used to import and randomize the data is attached to this repo.
My Tableau findings are [here](), in which you'll see some comparisons I was able to find from my *very* limited data. :)
